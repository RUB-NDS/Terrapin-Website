      TERMS AND DISCLAIMERS: We are providing this service to help system
      administrators initially assess and begin to correct vulnerable
      implementations. However, due to the limitations of our data and testing
      methodology, these results may be incomplete and may fail to indicate
      every vulnerable server, or they may falsely indicate non-vulnerable
      servers as vulnerable. They are based on data that is collected and
      processed in bulk, so they may be out of date and display implementations as
      vulnerable after the operators have mitigated the problem. By using this
      service, you agree to use it only for lawful purposes. Your access to
      and use of the service is at your own risk. You understand and agree
      that the service is provided to you on an &quot;AS IS&quot; basis. THE AUTHORS
      DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
