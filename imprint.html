      This website is provided by Fabian B&auml;umer. We do not collect
      any data, but we are making use of three third-party services that
      do. First, our site is hosted by GitHub Pages, a service
      provided by GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco,

      Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website,
      including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal

      Website and the Service. Second, our site is optimized and
      protected by Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St. San Francisco,
      CA 94107, USA. Cloudflare collects data when accessing our
      website, including IP addresses, system configuration
      information, and other information about traffic to and from the
      website to operate, maintain, and improve these services in
      performance of their obligations to us under
      the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare
        Privacy Policy</a>. For example, this data can help Cloudflare
      to detect new threats, identify malicious third parties, and

    <p>
      TERMS AND DISCLAIMERS: We are providing this service to help system
      administrators initially assess and begin to correct vulnerable
      implementations. However, due to the limitations of our data and testing
      methodology, these results may be incomplete and may fail to indicate
      every vulnerable server, or they may falsely indicate non-vulnerable
      servers as vulnerable. They are based on data that is collected and
      processed in bulk, so they may be out of date and display implementations as
      vulnerable after the operators have mitigated the problem. By using this
      service, you agree to use it only for lawful purposes. Your access to
      and use of the service is at your own risk. You understand and agree
      that the service is provided to you on an &quot;AS IS&quot; basis. THE AUTHORS
      DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
      FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
