  <section>
    <p>SSH is an internet standard that provides secure access to network services,
      particularly remote terminal login and file transfer within organizational networks
      and to over 15 million servers on the open internet.</p>

    <p><i>Terrapin</i> is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More precisely,
      Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By carefully adjusting
      the sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove an arbitrary amount
      of messages sent by the client or server at the beginning of the secure channel without
      the client or server noticing it.</p>

    <p>The attack can be performed in practice, allowing an attacker to downgrade the connection's
      security by truncating the extension negotiation message (RFC8308) from the transcript.
      The truncation can lead to using less secure client authentication algorithms and deactivating
      specific countermeasures against keystroke timing attacks in OpenSSH 9.5.</p>

    <p>We also showed that Terrapin can be used to enable the exploitation of implementation flaws.
      For example, we found several weaknesses in the AsyncSSH servers' state machine, allowing an
      attacker to sign a victim's client into another account without the victim noticing. Hence,
      it will enable strong phishing attacks and may grant the attacker Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
      capabilities within the encrypted session.</p>

    <p>To perform the Terrapin attack in practice, we require MitM capabilities at the network layer
      (the attacker must be able to intercept and modify the connection's traffic). Additionally,
      the connection must be secured by either ChaCha20-Poly1305 or CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC.
      However, our scan indicates an extensive adoption of these encryption modes; therefore,
      Terrapin applies to most real-world SSH sessions.</p>

    <h2>Attack Overview</h2>

    <img src="media/img/terrapin-attack.png">
    <p>The image shows a practical application of the Terrapin attack. The attacker can
      drop the EXT_INFO message, used for negotiating several protocol extensions, without
      the client or server noticing it. Usually, packet deletion would be detected by
      the client when receiving the next binary packet sent by the server, as sequence numbers
      would mismatch. To avoid this, an attacker injects an ignored packet during the handshake
      to offset the sequence numbers accordingly.

    <h2 id="scanner">Vulnerability Scanner</h2>

    <p>We provide a simple console application, written in Go, which can be used to determine
    whether an SSH server or client is vulnerable to the Terrapin attack. The scanner
    connects to your SSH server (or listens for an incoming client connection)
    to detect whether vulnerable encryption modes are offered and if the strict key exchange
    countermeasure is supported. It does not perform a fully-fledged handshake, nor does it
    actually perform the attack.</p>

    <p>Pre-built binaries for all major platforms and the source code are available on
      <a href="https://github.com/RUB-NDS/Terrapin-Scanner/releases/latest">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="question-answer">FAQ</h2>

    <h3>I am an admin, should I drop everything and fix this?</h3>

    <p>Probably not.</p>

    <p>The attack requires an active Man-in-the-Middle attacker that can intercept and
      modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer. Additionally,
      we require the negotiation of either ChaCha20-Poly1305, or any CBC cipher
      in combination with Encrypt-then-MAC as the connection's encryption mode.
    </p>

    <h3>What can the attackers gain?</h3>

    <p>Within the paper we describe an extension downgrade attack,
      allowing an attacker to downgrade the security of an SSH connection
      when using SSH extension negotiation. The impact in practice heavily
      depends on the supported extensions. Most commonly, this will impact
      the security of client authentication when using an RSA public key.
      When using OpenSSH 9.5, it may also be used to deactivate certain
      countermeasures to keystroke timing attacks.</p>

    <p>We also showed that the Terrapin attack can be used to enable
      certain attacks that exploit additional implementation flaws. For example,
      we used flaws in the internal state machine of AsyncSSH in combination
      with our attack to obtain a MitM position at the session layer.
    </p>

    <p>However, the potential consequences of the general Terrapin attack are
      dependent on the messages exchanged after the handshake concludes. If you
      are using a custom SSH service and do not resort to the authentication
      protocol, you should check that dropping the first few messages of a connection
      does not yield security risks.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is vulnerable?</h3>
    <p>Almost everyone. The Terrapin attack exploits weaknesses in the SSH transport
      layer protocol in combination with newer cryptographic algorithms and encryption
      modes introduced by OpenSSH over 10 years ago. Since then, these have been adopted
      by a wide range of SSH implementations, therefore affecting a majority of current
      implementations.</p>

    <p>In practice, our attack can be applied against any connection using either
      ChaCha20-Poly1305 or any CBC-mode cipher in combination with the Encrypt-then-MAC paradigm.
      Theoretically, CTR-mode ciphers in combination with the Encrypt-then-MAC paradigm are
      vulnerable as well, although this weakness cannot be exploited in a real-world scenario.</p>

    <h3>So how practical is the attack?</h3>
    <p>The terrapin attack requires an active Man-in-the-Middle attacker, that means some way
      for an attacker to intercept and modify the data sent from the client or server
      to the remote peer. This is difficult on the Internet, but can be a plausible
      attacker model on the local network.</p>

    <p>Besides that, we also require the use of a vulnerable encryption mode. Encrypt-then-MAC
      and ChaCha20-Poly1305 have been introduced by OpenSSH over 10 years ago. Both have
      become the default for many years and as such spread across the SSH ecosystem. Our scan
      indicated that at least 77% of SSH servers on the internet supported at least one
      mode that can be exploited in practice.</p>

    <h3>Is my SSH client/server vulnerable?</h3>

    <p>Most likely, yes. If you refrained from updating your system's SSH implementation
      in the last decade, or configured your SSH implementation to solely use the
      Encrypt-and-MAC encryption mode, today might be your lucky day.</p>

    <p>In more technical terms, if your SSH implementations supports (and is configured to offer) the
      <code>chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</code> encryption algorithm, or any encryption algorithm suffixed
      <code>-cbc</code> in combination with any MAC algorithm suffixed <code>-etm@openssh.com</code>,
      you are vulnerable to Terrapin.
    </p>

    <p>You can use our <a href="#scanner">vulnerability scanner</a> to determine whether your client or server is vulnerable.</p>

    <h3>I patched my SSH client/server, am I safe now?</h3>

    <p>It depends. The strict key exchange countermeasure implemented by OpenSSH and other vendors
      requires both, client and server, to support it, in order to take effect. Connecting a vulnerable
      client to a patched server, and vice versa, still results in a vulnerable connection.</p>
      
    <h3>Is this a new attack?</h3>
    <p>The Terrapin attack can be considered the first attack in a new family of attacks
      targeting cryptographic network protocols and is the first ever practically exploitable
      prefix truncation attack that we know of. The only other mentioning of a prefix truncation
      attack was by Cédric Fournet on behalf of the miTLS team on an
      <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/extoO9ETJLnEm3MRDTO23x70DFM/">IETF mailing list</a>. Fournet
      described potential weaknesses in a draft version of TLS 1.3 that used to not reset sequence
      numbers when activating new keys, although his considerations remained theoretical as "[...]
      prefix truncations will probably cause the handshake to fail". The draft was subsequently
      changed and no prefix truncation attacks in TLS 1.3 are known to this date.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is the attack called "Terrapin"?</h3>

    <p>The name "Terrapin" started as an acronym, but considering how tortured it looked,
      we opted to drop the acronym part and only retained the name. We chose this name
      because SSH and terrapins have one thing in common: Shells. And I think we can all
      agree that terrapins (and turtles in general) are cute animals.</p>

    <h3>How have vendors responded to this vulnerability?</h3>

    <p>Many vendors have updated their SSH implementation to support an optional strict
      key exchange. Strict key exchange is a backwards-incompatible change to the SSH
      handshake which introduces sequence number resets and takes away an attacker's capability
      to inject packets during the initial, unencrypted handshake. However, to take effect, both
      client and server must support this feature.</p>

    <h3>What about other protocols?</h3>

    <p>To this date, we are not aware of any practical prefix truncation in other cryptographic
      network protocols. All versions of TLS reset the message sequence number to zero when
      changing key, therefore decoupling unencrypted and encrypted sequence numbers. Additionally,
      TLS authenticates the entire handshake thus preventing an attacker from inserting
      any message. While IPSec/IKE only authenticates parts of its handshake, the sequence numbers
      are reset similar to TLS, rendering it immune to our attack.</p>


    <h3>Is this vulnerability severe enough to deserve a name, a logo and a web page?</h3>

    <p>Terrapin is not a simple software bug that can be fixed with an update
      to a single library or component. Instead, clients and servers need
      to be updated to protect the connection against prefix truncation
      attacks. This means we need to raise awareness of the issue across all
      SSH client and server implementations, which is a considerable effort. We expect
      that the general Terrapin attack will stay with us for many years, so we
      have a cute animal to keep us company while we help clients and servers
      to adopt the suggested countermeasures!</p>
